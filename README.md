# Fusion Radar Model

MATLAB model for a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave(FMCW) radar to be used for measuring plasma in a fusion reactor.

The radar model is based on the [AWR2944](https://www.ti.com/product/AWR2944) radar on the [AWR2944EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/AWR2944EVM) evaluation board.

The intention of this model is to trial different DSP techniques before hardware testing.

Made for S7 DSS project fall / winter 2023.
